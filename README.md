# uix

uix is a comprehensive library designed for developing both front-end and back-end web applications using Python. This library was inspired by the Gradio library (https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio.git), which primarily offers interfaces for simple AI applications. Recognizing a need for a more robust solution, uix extends beyond AI to support a broader range of web development needs.

During its development, we evaluated several other frameworks, including Streamlit and NiceGui. Each platform has its strengths and limitations, but none fully met our requirements. This exploration not only informed our design decisions but also provided substantial learning opportunities, aligning with one of our key project goals.

To explore uix and see it in action, start with the uix-demo repository:

[uix-demo](https://github.com/aitsis/uix-demo.git)

**Current Project Objectives:**
- Expand the documentation to ensure ease of use and accessibility.
- Create and share a wider variety of example projects to demonstrate the library's capabilities.

## Installation Requirements

Before installing uix, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or newer
